# üìä Inventory Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing stock levels and order quantities to identify potential issues and improve inventory management. Below are the key analyses included in the project:

## üìù Key Analyses

1. **Sorted List of Products with Insufficient Stock**
   - Provides a ranked list of products that have stock levels below the required amount, helping to prioritize restocking efforts.

2. **Order Quantity Chart (UnitsOnOrder)**
   - Visualizes the quantities ordered for different products, giving insights into current demand.

3. **Products with Both Insufficient Stock and Low Order Quantity**
   - Identifies products that not only have insufficient stock but also low quantities on order, indicating a potential risk of stockouts.

4. **Order Quantities for Products Below Stock Level**
   - Analyzes the order quantities for products that are below their desired stock level to support proactive replenishment.

## üìà Objective
The main goal of this analysis is to enhance inventory management by identifying products that require attention due to low stock or inadequate order quantities. This helps in optimizing stock levels, minimizing potential stockouts, and improving overall inventory control.
